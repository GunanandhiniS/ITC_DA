axis = 0 means, it will take all the elements as individual values
axis = 0 means, it will take column values.
axis = 1 means , it will do operations along row wise.
[rows,cols]



    x[1:4, 1:3]:
        This uses slicing for both dimensions.
        The first slice (1:4) selects rows 1 to 3 (exclusive of index 4).
        The second slice (1:3) selects columns 1 to 2 (exclusive of index 3).
        Therefore, it selects a rectangular region from rows 1 to 3 and columns 1 to 2.

    x[1:4, [1, 2]]:
        This uses slicing for the first dimension (1:4) to select rows 1 to 3.
        It uses indexing with a list for the second dimension ([1, 2]).
        The list [1, 2] specifies the columns you want to select, which are columns 1 and 2.
        Therefore, it selects rows 1 to 3 but only columns 1 and 2, not the entire range between them.

        In C-style order, the elements are iterated over in row-major order (along the last axis), while in F-style order, the iteration is in column-major order (along the first axis). The printed results demonstrate the difference in iteration order.




In the line x[...] = 2 * x, the expression x[...] is a shorthand for assigning values to all elements in the current iteration of the np.nditer loop. It's a convenient way to update the array in place.

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

    x is an iterator that points to the current element in the array during each iteration of the loop.
    x[...] is a slice that represents the entire array element at the current iteration.
    2 * x is the result of multiplying the current element by 2.

So, x[...] = 2 * x is essentially saying "replace the current element with its value multiplied by 2" for each iteration of the loop. This operation is performed in-place, directly modifying the original array a.

In simpler terms, it's a concise way to perform element-wise multiplication of the array by 2.

Broadcasting is a feature in NumPy that allows for operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes. When performing operations on arrays, NumPy automatically broadcasts the smaller array to make it compatible with the larger array, thus avoiding the need for explicit looping or element-wise operations.

The general rule of broadcasting is that the dimensions of the arrays must be compatible. Two dimensions are considered compatible when:

    They are equal, or
    One of them is 1.

Here's a simple example to illustrate broadcasting:


--
import numpy as np

# Creating a 2D array (3x3)
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6],
              [7, 8, 9]])

# Creating a 1D array (1x3)
b = np.array([10, 20, 30])

# Broadcasting: Adding a 2D array and a 1D array
result = a + b

print("Array a:")
print(a)

print("\nArray b:")
print(b)

print("\nResult after broadcasting:")
print(result)

--
In this example, the smaller array b is broadcasted to the shape of the larger array a 
so that the addition operation can be performed element-wise. The result is:


Array a:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]

Array b:
[10 20 30]

Result after broadcasting:
[[11 22 33]
 [14 25 36]
 [17 28 39]]

NumPy automatically replicates the values of the smaller array along the necessary
 dimensions to make the shapes compatible for the addition operation.

Broadcasting simplifies operations on arrays of different shapes and promotes
concise and readable code. It is a powerful feature that enhances the flexibility and 
efficiency of array operations in NumPy.
